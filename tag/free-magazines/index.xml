Raspberry Pi Press umbrella and discuss how to easily access them all.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://store.rpipress.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi Press&lt;/a> is a part of the Raspberry Pi Foundation
and the publisher of a great deal of magazines and books.
Among the many magazines edited, some are freely available for download,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HackSpace&lt;/a> is a monthly publication dedicated to those who love to make things
and learn while doing it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelloWorld&lt;/a> is published three times a year and targets educators
of the computing and digital world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MagPi&lt;/a> is the official magazine of the Raspberry Pi and is loaded
with stories and project based on the single board computer.
Published every month, the latest issue is numbered N°95 as of the time of writing,
making it an incredible source of inspiration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiredframe&lt;/a> is published every 2 weeks and is entirely dedicated
to video games. But unlike other video game magazines, it offers
to look at how they are made, who make them and offer a lot of resources
to get started writing your own games.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On top of that, The Raspberry Pi Press also publishes many great books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each magazine can be bought online and shipped around the globe.
One can also sign for a yearly subscription, offering some
discount and/or goodies. At the same time, issues are freely available
to download in pdf from the magazine websites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="bookshelf">Bookshelf&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Recently the
&lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/latest-raspberry-pi-os-update-may-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi Foundation presented the Raspberry Pi OS&lt;/a>,
a rebranding of Raspbian, highlighting some of its novelties.
Among those novelties, they showcased a neat little app named &lt;code>Bookshelf&lt;/code>
that allows you to browse and download the issues of
several magazines edited by the Raspberry Pi Press.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application is a simple interface listing all issues of each magazine
but also some of the books.
It allows for simply downloading any issue by simply clicking on
the desired cover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://artivis.github.io/img/post/bookshelf.png" alt="The Bookshelf app">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately this great app is only available through the Pi OS
archive and its
&lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;amp;t=278584&amp;amp;p=1687369&amp;amp;hilit=bookshelf#p1687369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code is not public&lt;/a> at the time of writing.
One can still download the deb package and install it manually.
To do so, visit the
&lt;a href="http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/r/rp-bookshelf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app archive&lt;/a> and look for the latest
version of the debian package for your machine architecture.
At the moment it is &lt;code>rp-bookshelf_0.4_amd64.deb&lt;/code> for common computers.
From there, we can simply download the debian and install it,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">$ wget http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/r/rp-bookshelf/rp-bookshelf_0.4_amd64.deb
$ dpkg -i rp-bookshelf_0.4_amd64.deb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To launch the app simply type,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">$ rp-bookshelf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Altho this procedure works fine, it is a little unpleasant.
Furthermore, I personally don&amp;rsquo;t care much about the GUI and I&amp;rsquo;d rather prefer
to automatically download the latest issues I care for.
If you feel the same, keep on reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="rpipress-downloader">rpipress-downloader&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Raspberry Pi Press Store was
&lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-raspberry-pi-press-store-is-looking-mighty-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently entirely redesigned&lt;/a>
bringing some uniformization across all the magazine websites.
That allows us to write a small web scrapping script to automatically
download the latest (or all) issues and books of our favorite magazine(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went ahead and did just that, writing a small Python script that you can find
on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/artivis/rpipress-downloader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github&lt;/a>, or conveniently install as a Snap as follows,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">sudo snap install rpipress-downloader
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Its use it pretty simple, launch the script in a terminal
and by default it will automatically search and download the latest issue of all
aforementioned magazines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further options let you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>specify which magazine to download
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">rpipress-downloader --magazines magpi hackspace
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>download &lt;strong>all&lt;/strong> issues,
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">rpipress-downloader --all
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>download the books too,
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">rpipress-downloader --books
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>combine options so that,
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">rpipress-downloader -a -m magpi -b
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>will download all MagPi issues and books.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Issues and books are saved respectively in&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>~/rpipress/{magazine}&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>~/rpipress/{magazine}/Books&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>or, using the snap, in&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>~/snap/rpipress-downloader/current/rpipress/{magazine}&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>~/snap/rpipress-downloader/current/rpipress/{magazine}/Books&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note that the script conveniently let you know the path by printing an
hyperlink in the console,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">$ rpipress-downloader -m magpi
Latest MagPi issue is N°95
