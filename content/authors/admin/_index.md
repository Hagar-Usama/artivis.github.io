Jérémie Deray is a software engineer at
[Canonical](https://canonical.com/),
the company publishing [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
As part of the robotics team he is working on both ROS and ROS 2 -
development, maintenance, dev tools, security, snaps...
Before that he worked five years at
[PAL Robotics](https://pal-robotics.com/en/home/) on navigation,
perception and a little bit of control, this for various robots -
mobile-base, mobile-manipulator, semi-humanoid.

In parallel, Jérémie has been pursuing a PhD on the theme of
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
applied to industrial mobile-bases. The research is taking place in a collaborative framework
between the company [PAL Robotics](https://pal-robotics.com/en/home/) and
the [Universitat Politècnica De Catalunya (IRI-UPC)](https://www.iri.upc.edu/),
both in the lovely city of Barcelona, Spain.
The research work is supervised by [Joan Solà](http://www.joansola.eu/) and
[Juan Andrade Cetto](https://www.iri.upc.edu/staff/cetto).
