How does one set that up quickly when starting from scratch? Do you Remember those HTML courses?\nYeah me neither.\nBut fortunately for us it is now easier than ever!\nWe will discuss in this post how to create our own website with the Hugo framework from a template and how to deploy it to GitHub. The prerequisites are,\n GitHub markdown  LXD (optional)  You may find GitHub tutorials here and there. Pages of our website will be written in markdown. You can learn more about markdown from those tutorials, in English and in French. And if you only need a brief refresh, here is the syntax supported by our website. Finally, you can find a LXD tutorial here.\nNow, let us set up the necessary stuff to get started, shall we?\nPicking a website template To build our website, we will use the framework Hugo. It is very convenient for our use case because it comes with a ton of predefined website themes and it is very simple to use.\nFor the purpose of this tutorial we will use the very theme of this website, namely, Academic. This theme is rather clean, well organized, fairly simple to use and most importantly it is well documented! Furthermore, it can be found pre-bundled in a Hugo project so that it is pretty much clone and play. However, at the time of writing, this theme requires Hugo *Extended* version 0.67+. This distinction is important because, while it is conveniently packaged as a snap, the snap only offers the classic version, not the Extended. Therefore we have to fetch its debian package and install it manually.\nFirst, let us clone the ready-to-go Academic bundle on our machine:\ncd ~/ git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git my_website cd my_website git submodule update --init --recursive  Prepping the tools To avoid polluting our system, we will set up a Linux container in which we will install Hugo Extended. The container is totally optional and you can do the installation directly on your machine. If you do not wish to use a container, skip directly to Hugo installation\nSetting up the LXC Let us start a fresh and pull a new Ubuntu 18.04 instance,\nlxc launch ubuntu:18.04 hugo  We will now mount a disk device to share the website source code between our machine and the container:\nlxc config device add hugo workspace disk source=~/my_website path=/home/ubuntu/my_website lxc config set hugo raw.idmap \u0026quot;both $(id -u) $(id -g)\u0026quot; lxc restart hugo  The default installation of LXD set up a bridged network so that containers live behind a NAT on the host. Therefore, we have to forward the port on which our website is served by the Hugo framework. To do so, issue the following command:\nlxc config device add hugo proxy1313 proxy connect=tcp:127.0.0.1:1313 listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:1313  The container is all set up. We can log to it with:\nlxc exec hugo -- su --login ubuntu  Installing Hugo We will download the Hugo extended debian directly from it GitHub repository. To do so, enter in the terminal:\nwget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.70.0/hugo_extended_0.70.0_Linux-64bit.deb  At the time of writing, the latest Hugo Extended release is version 0.70.0.\nWe can now install it with:\nsudo dpkg -i hugo_extended_*.deb  First view of our website Let the show begin. We are now ready to spawn our website and browse it. In a terminal, enter:\ncd ~/my_website hugo server  Voila!\nThe website it up and running! To visualize it, open your web browser at the address http://localhost:1313. That was easy right?\nMaking the website your own We have a great template up and running, it is now time to make it our own. The Academic theme comes with a ton of options and configurations allowing us to truly personalize it to our liking and use case. And since its online documentation is so great, I will let you discovers by yourself all the possibilities the theme offers. Head down to the Academic get started documentation and have fun!\nJust a quick advice, as you edit your website, let Hugo run. It is able to update the website live so that you see your changes take effect immediately in your web browser!\nDeploying the website to GitHub Once our website is ready to be made public, all there is to do is to push it to GitHub. Well, almost.\nIn your GitHub account, we will create a repository to host your website. To do so hit the tiny cross (+) in the top-right of GitHub and select new repository. For GitHub to be able to figure out that this particular repository is your personal website we need to give it a specific name in the form : \u0026lt;your-github-user-name\u0026gt;.github.io.\nWe will now prepare to push the website to this repository.\nFirst we will add the GitHub repository we just created as our remote,\ngit add remote origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;your-github-user-name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your-github-user-name\u0026gt;.github.io.git  and change our branch name to avoid later mess,\ngit branch -m master builder  Here comes the final step before pushing to GitHub. We must build our website, or rather let Hugo do it for us. Indeed so far we have edited the template that Hugo uses to build the website. We have visualized it in our browser but the template cannot be deployed directly to GitHub, it must be built. To build it locally, nothing easier, simply run:\nhugo  You will notice a new folder named public in our project. It contains the generated website. It is this content that we must push to our repository. Furthermore, it must be pushed specifically to the master branch. That\u0026rsquo;s a limitation of personal website on GitHub.\nAutomatic deployment So how could we automatize this build and deploy process?\nWe will add a small script so that every times we push some new content on the builder branch, GitHub will take care of calling Hugo (building) and moving the public folder directly on the master branch (deploying).\nFor that, we will use GitHub actions and more specifically the actions-hugo. Sorry buddy but I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the details about actons here as it is all new to me as well. That could be the topic for a later post tho.\nWe will simply create a new file in our project to configure the action:\ncd ~/my_website touch .github/workflows/deploy-website.yml  which we will edit as follows:\nname: deploy website # We will run the actions whenever something # is pushed to the branch 'builder' on: push: branches: - builder jobs: # Our action is called 'deploy' and runs on Ubuntu 18.04 deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-18.04 # The action executes the following steps steps: # It fetch our repository and its submodules - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod # It then set up Hugo Extended - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: '0.68.3' extended: true # It runs Hugo to generate the website - name: Build run: hugo --minify # It copies the content of the 'public' folder to the branch 'master' - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public publish_branch: master  With our automatic deployment configured, all there remains to do is to push to GitHub!\nLet us remove the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder is it exists,\ncd ~/my_website rm -r public  and commit all of our changes,\ngit add . git commit 'made the website my own'  Finally, we push the changes upstream,\ngit push origin builder  Voila!\nAfter a couple minutes your website is now available at the address:\nhttps://\u0026lt;your-github-user-name\u0026gt;.github.io/\nCongrats on your new online visibility, our job here is done.\nBonus: Academic publications If you happen to have some academic publications that you would like to showcase on your website, we will install a Python tool called academic that will help us to automatically generate pages from Bibtex.\nFirst we will install pip3:\napt install python3-pip  to then install academic:\npip3 install -U academic  Given that we have a .bib file that contains all of our publications, we can generate the pages as follows:\ncd ~/my_website academic import --bibtex \u0026lt;path_to_your/publications.bib\u0026gt;  You can find more information in the Academic theme documentation.\n","date":1588982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590795601,"objectID":"1935ac9469e8a1f3c15b0c1795f0e181","permalink":"https://artivis.github.io/post/2020/my-website/","publishdate":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020/my-website/","section":"post","summary":"Here we are, looking for online visibility.

Based on a Timed-Elastic Band, the problem is defined so that the trajectory lies on a spline in SE(2) with non-vanishing n-th derivatives at every point. Formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem, it allows imposing soft constraints such as collision-avoidance, velocity, acceleration and jerk limits, and more. The planning process is realtime-capable allowing the robot to navigate in dynamic complex scenarios. The proposed method is compared against the state-of-the-art in various scenarios. Results show that trajectories generated by the TESC planner have smaller average acceleration and are more efficient in terms of total curvature and pseudo-kinetic energy while being produced with more consistency than state-of-the-art planners do.","tags":null,"title":"Timed-elastic smooth curve optimization for mobile-base motion planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

However, it is still challenging for the state-of-the-art methods to handle multiple conditions that allow better paths to be found. For example, considering joint limits, path smoothness and a mixture of Cartesian and joint-space constraints at the same time pose a significant challenge for many of them. This letter proposes to use timed-elastic bands for representing the manipulation motion planning problem, allowing to apply continuously optimized constraints to the problem during the search for a solution. Due to the nature of our method, it is highly extensible with new constraints or optimization objectives. The proposed approach is compared against state-of-the-art methods in various manipulation scenarios. The results show that it is more consistent and less variant, while performing in a comparable manner to that of the state of the art. This behavior allows the proposed method to set a lower-bound performance guarantee for other methods to build upon.","tags":null,"title":"Timed-Elastic Bands for Manipulation Motion Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

We use iterative nonlinear on-manifold optimization with a graphical representation of the state, and resort to an adaptation of the pre-integration theory, initially developed for the IMU motion sensor, to be applied to the differential drive motion model. For this, we describe the construction of a pre-integrated factor for the differential drive motion model, which includes the motion increment, its covariance, and a first-order approximation of its dependence with the calibration parameters. As the calibration parameters change at each solver iteration, this allows a posteriori factor correction without the need of re-integrating the motion data. We validate our proposal in simulations and on a real robot and show the convergence of the calibration towards the true values of the parameters. It is then tested online in simulation and is shown to accommodate to variations in the calibration parameters when the vehicle is subject to physical changes such as loading and unloading a freight.","tags":["Calibration;Robot sensing systems;Wheels;Kinematics;Jacobian matrices;Mobile robots"],"title":"Joint on-manifold self-calibration of odometry model and sensor extrinsics using pre-integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We will find in a near future more and more robots in our environment, including public places (e.g. malls, museums, hospitals). This requires a strong robustness in any task to ensure the safety of both people and robots. If nowadays we can find pretty accurate sensors (e.g. laser range finder), they however are of little help in crowded places. Especially since humanoid robots are still a curiosity for the public and as such are often completely surrounded. This is why it is important to investigate sensors which provide as much information as possible for the lowest cost possible. Omnidirectional cameras are well suited for this task. Indeed as shown in this thesis, two fisheye cameras are enough to get a full 360° view of the robot environment. This permits in a first place the robot to localize itself and in a second place, any usual use of camera can be adapted such as navigation, face detection etc.\nYoutube video     Few Images ","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589060872,"objectID":"824d9f18212c0aa7d4461c87a1cf1ac6","permalink":"https://artivis.github.io/project/mscv_thesis/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mscv_thesis/","section":"project","summary":"We will find in a near future more and more robots in our environment, including public places (e.g. malls, museums, hospitals).

As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.","tags":null,"title":"A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Consistent with the state of the art, the map is encoded as a graph of poses, and to cope with very large mapping capabilities, loop closures are asserted by comparing the features extracted from a query laser scan against a previously acquired corpus of scan features using a bag-of-words (BoW) scheme. Two contributions are here presented. First, to benefit from the graph topology, feature frequency scores in the BoW are computed not only for each individual scan but also from neighboring scans in the SLAM graph. This has the effect of enforcing neighbor relational information during document matching. Second, a weak geometric check that takes into account feature ordering and occlusions is introduced that substantially improves loop closure detection performance. The two contributions are evaluated both separately and jointly on four common SLAM datasets and are shown to improve the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of precision and recall in most of the cases. Moreover, our current implementation is designed to work at nearly frame rate, allowing loop closure query resolution at nearly 22 Hz for the best case scenario and 2 Hz for the worst case scenario.","tags":null,"title":"Word ordering and document adjacency for large loop closure detection in 2D laser maps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.
