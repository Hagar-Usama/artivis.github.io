This is going to be a very very short post with a unique aim, promoting [lspdlog](https://github.com/artivis/lspdlog).

It is a very thin wrapper around another project called [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) which is a fast, light-weight, c++, header only logging library.  

This wrapper has no other purpose than enabling cool logging macro for your project.

If you've worked with [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/rosconsole) then you already know `ROS_INFO(...)` and such.

The idea here is to enable the same kind of macro for your own project ->  
`MY_COOL_PROJECT_INFO()` and such.

Wanna know how ??

Check [lspdlog on gihub](https://github.com/artivis/lspdlog) !

**Spoiler Alert** :

**lspdlog** stands for *Lazy* spdlog. That's quite some piece of info.  
*Lazy* because made easy to use !!!
